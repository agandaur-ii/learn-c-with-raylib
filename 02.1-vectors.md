Lets make some small modifications to our last example to use
something called a vector. Vectors are going to be very important as
we move forward and make more games. You can think of vectors as two
integers that represent a point in space.

In our screen saver example we often reffered to x and y together
since they are used together to represent the x and y position of an
object in our game. We can clearify our program by replacing our
references to x and y with a reference to a position vector2.

We have some code in our `main` method that has similar variable names
`saverPositionX`, `saverPositionY`, `speedX` and `speedY`. These
variables seem like they are doing something related to each other, so
we can update our program to make its structure communicate that.

in our `main` method, lets replace these variables with two vectors,
one that represents the speed and one that represents the position.

```c
// Before:
// int saverPositionX = 140;
// int saverPositionY = 140;

//  int speedX = 1;
//  int speedY = 1;

// After:
Vector2 saverPosition = { 140, 140 };
Vector2 speed = { 1, 1 };
```

You can ask these Vector2s questions about their `x` and `y`
values. Like we can write `saverPosition.x` and get the x position
that way. This means that we can update our program to use
`saverPosition.x` when we used to use `saverPositionX` and everything
should work just like before.

Feel free to go through the program and update your variables to their new names,
- `saverPositionX` becomes `saverPosition.x`
- `saverPositionY` becomes `saverPosition.y`
- `speedX` becomes `speed.x`
- `speedY` becomes `speed.y`

If you are feeling lazy and don't want to make these changes manually,
you can run this sed script and it will make the changes for you.

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/saverPositionX/saverPosition.x/g; s/saverPositionY/saverPosition.y/g; s/speedX/speed.x/g; s/speedY/speed.y/g;' dvd.c
```

You can learn more about using sed and how you can use it to automate
parts of your workflow and use it to save yourself time in the future!

### Speed and Position seem like very different things, why are they both vectors?

Despite being represented as the same kind of thing, speed and
position (at least conceptually) are very different things. Position
is a location in the world. Does that mean that `speed` is a location
in the world at (1,1)? That can't be the case.

Despite looking very similar speed is actually a different concept
from position. speed is representing the amount of change you want to
make in the position. Implicit in this is that this is the amount you
want the object to move "per frame." so if your game draws a frame
every 1/6th of a second, the position of the dvd screen saver will
move by (1, 1) each frame. It is helpful to remember that some vectors
can be "relative" vectors (talking about the amount of change between
two things) and some are "absolute vectors" which talk about the
distance from the upper left corner of the game world.
